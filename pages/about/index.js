            <h3>Project Results</h3>
            <p>
              Given that this was my first ever NextJS App, the project came out
              pretty good. There was a very steep learning curve and a 4 day
              deadline which resulted in the entire framework being produced
              within 4 days, with minimal styling. After a further few days of
              styling and modications &#40;and a lot of code cleaning&#41;, I am
              proud of my experience and work progress with this project.
