            <p>
              To explore building an app from scratch using NextJS, and
              accessing and filtering API retrieved data using Vercels API.
              Styling was performed using Style Components.

              <AboutListItem>
                Access Vercels art API and manipulate the fetched data.
              </AboutListItem>
              <AboutListItem>
                Produce a gallery that exhibits work in multiple views. Art
                should be displayed:
                <AboutTextOL>
                  <AboutListItem>
                    In a grid formation showing work title and artist name.
                  </AboutListItem>
                  <AboutListItem>
                    As a single tile displaying only the piece title and the
                    artist name. The view had to have a next and previous image
                    option.
                  </AboutListItem>
                  <AboutListItem>
                    With a filter showing only the users favourited items.
                  </AboutListItem>
                  <AboutListItem>
                    In a detail page showing all relevant data regarding an
                    individual piece of art.
                  </AboutListItem>
                </AboutTextOL>
              </AboutListItem>
              <AboutListItem>
                Allow for saving and loading of relevant data within local
                storage in order for users to add specific pieces to a
                favourites list and save personal comments and ideas for
                specific pieces.

            <h3>Project Results</h3>
            <p>
              Given that this was my first ever NextJS App, the project came out
              pretty good. There was a very steep learning curve and a 4 day
              deadline which resulted in the entire framework being produced
              within 4 days, with minimal styling. After a further few days of
              styling and modications &#40;and a lot of code cleaning&#41;, I am
              proud of my experience and work progress with this project.
